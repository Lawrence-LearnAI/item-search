Here’s what I found for your mint Berlin postcard (Brandenburg Gate) search:

🖼️ Example item - Wandering Jew postcard, ca. 1908

🏷️ Market: Delcampe

💰 Price: $19.99 USD

📅 Listed: 2025-10-31

🔗 View on Delcampe

That’s the only relevant match under your criteria (mint, max $15, English & German listings).
Would you like me to broaden the search — for instance, include postally used cards, raise the price limit, or add more markets (e.g., Philasearch, Bidspirit, Mercari JP)?
